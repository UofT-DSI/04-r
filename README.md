## Course Overview

## Description
This course is designed as an immersive learning experience. The estimated time commitment consists of approximately 20 hours of in-class instruction, and 8 hours of optional but highly recommended tutorials. In total, learners can expect to dedicate approximately 28 hours over a span of 10 days to successfully complete the course.

The first part of this course teaches R with a focus on manipulating and visualizing data. Learners will get set up with a functional RStudio workflow, use different file types, transform data tables, import and manipulate data, use functions and loops, create data visualizations, and learn how to solve problems with their programming. Both base R and tidyverse methods are taught. To work reproducibly, learners will create R Projects. The second part of the course will cover the ethics of consent, Equity, Diversity & Inclusion (EDI) training, and professional skills including presentation, project management, and data security. Finally, the course will conclude with an industry case study. 

This course is designed for those who have a degree in something other than Computer Science/Statistics who are looking to enhance their data science skills for their career.

## Learning Outcomes
By the end of this course, learners will be able to:

1. Gain proficiency in utilizing R by understanding various options available for working with R, comprehending the purpose of RStudio and R Projects, adhering to best coding practices in R, and recognizing the position of R among other data science tools.

2. Apply manipulation and wrangling techniques to describe and define the characteristics of datasets. Learners will become proficient in accessing built-in R datasets and importing external datasets into R, identifying and describing data structures, reshaping datasets through manipulation techniques, detecting missing values, cleaning data, summarizing data, exporting data, and reporting findings. Learners will also be able to produce a wide range of informative and visually appealing charts, graphs, and plots to effectively communicate insights and patterns hidden within the data.

3. Develop the skills and strategies necessary to diagnose and fix errors in R. Learners will gain proficiency in interpreting error messages, identifying common coding mistakes, and utilizing debugging tools and techniques effectively. Learners will be able to apply systematic approaches to troubleshoot and resolve errors in their R code.

4. Demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of the concept of consent in data-based studies. Learners will be able to identify the ethical considerations and legal requirements related to obtaining informed consent from participants, and apply appropriate strategies to ensure ethical data  usage.

5. Acquire the skills and knowledge required to create compelling presentations and effectively manage projects using R. Learners will demonstrate proficiency in utilizing R's visualization and presentation packages to generate visually appealing and informative slides, charts, and graphs. They will also gain proficiency in project management techniques specific to R, including organizing and structuring R code, as well as effectively documenting code.
